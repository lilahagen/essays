 **DESDEMONA**, ⌜*singing*⌝ </br> 
 *The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,* </br>
 *Sing all a green ==willow.=={Q36050}* </br>
 *Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,* </br>
 *Sing willow, willow, willow.* </br>
 *The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her </br>
  moans,* </br>
  *Sing willow, willow, willow;* </br>
  *Her salt tears fell from her, and softened the </br>
  stones—* </br>

 *<p style="color:darkseagreen; background-color:honeydew">* This is a song that Desdemona's maid, Barbary, sang while dying after her lover left her -- an example of doomed love. In this way, Barbary is a parallel character for Desdemona, who is seeming to foreshadow her own fate...
  
 Lay by these. </br>
*Sing willow, willow, willow.*  </p>

  *<p style="color:hotpink; background-color:lavenderblush">* The willow song is an Elizabethan folk song, originally published in 1583 in a book of lute music. The original song was about a man who dies because of his lover's betrayal, but Shakespeare changed the victim of the song from a man to a woman.

Prithee hie thee! He’ll come anon. </br>

*Sing all a green willow must be my garland*. </br>
*Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve.* </br>

Nay, that’s not next. Hark, who is ’t that knocks? </br>  

*<p style="color:mediumpurple; background-color:lavender">* The way that Desdemona continues to interrupt her singing, and even messes up the lyrics ("Nay, that's not next"), humanizes her, because it shows that she is vulnerable and not immune to making mistakes. This undermines her image as a naive, untouchable, and idealized woman, and Shakespeare purposely interjects impefections to remind us that no woman has a single facet to her identity.

**EMILIA** </br> 
It’s the wind. </br>

**DESDEMONA,** ⌜*singing*⌝ </br>
 *I called my love false love, but what said he then? *</br>
 *Sing willow, willow, willow.* </br>
 *If I court more women, you’ll couch with more </br>
  men.* </p>

  *<p style="color:darkseagreen; background-color:honeydew">* A willow tree, or a "weeping willow," is a conventional symbol of grief and mourning, as well as dissapointed love. Shakespeare's use of this particular image foreshadows  Desdemona's death at the hands her of lover despite her devotion. Shakespeare has used this image before -- in ==*Hamlet,*=={Q41567} ==Ophelia=={Q1800888} drowns herself surrounded by willow trees after her lover, Hamlet, rejects her.
 
</p> 'So, get thee gone. Good night. Mine eyes do itch; </br>
 Doth that bode weeping? </br>
 
 *<p style="color:mediumpurple; background-color:lavender">*  Desdemona abruptly dismisses Emilia, perhaps because the song had touched too closely upon her actual life. This shows that Desdemona is conscious of her own predicament and also the control Othello's violence has over her entire life. It also highlights the close relationship between her and Emilia, as she feels comfortable being vulnerable in her prescence. 

**EMILIA** </br>
 ’Tis neither here nor there.</br>

**DESDEMONA** </br>
 I have heard it said so. O these men, these men! </br>
 Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia— </br>
 That there be women do abuse their husbands </br>
 In such gross kind? </br>

**EMILIA** </br>
There be some such, no </br>
 question. </br>

**DESDEMONA**  </br>
 Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? </br>

**EMILIA** </br>
Why, would not you? </br>

**DESDEMONA** </br>
 No, by this heavenly light! </br>

**EMILIA** </br>
 Nor I neither, by this heavenly light. </br>
 I might do ’t as well i’ th’ dark. </br>
 
*<p style="color:darkseagreen; background-color:honeydew">* A play on words! Desdemona says she wouldn't cheat on Othello by day... and Emilia responds that she wouldn't either, but might in the night! 

**DESDEMONA** </br>
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? </br>

**EMILIA** </br> 
The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price </br>
 for a small vice. </br>

**DESDEMONA** </br>
In [troth](https://www.shakespeareswords.com/Public/GlossaryHeadword.aspx?headwordId=5555), I think thou wouldst not. </br>

**EMILIA** </br>
 In [troth](https://www.shakespeareswords.com/Public/GlossaryHeadword.aspx?headwordId=5555), I think I should, and undo ’t when I </br>
 had done ⟨it.⟩ Marry, I would not do such a thing for </br>
 a joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for </br>
 gowns, ==petticoats=={Q1062620}, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition. </br>
 But for the whole world—⟨’Uds pity!⟩ Who </br>
 would not make her husband a [cuckold](https://www.shakespeareswords.com/Public/Glossary.aspx?Id=2786) to make </br>
 him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for ’t. </br>

  *<p style="color:hotpink; background-color:lavenderblush">* "Gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition..." These costume design sketches from the 1920s give us an idea of what Desdemona would be wearing onstage! Her extravagant and lavish styles would contrast Emilia's more simple everyday outfits, which would further develop their juxtaposition as two types of women. 

**DESDEMONA**  </br>
Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong </br>
 for the whole world! </br>

**EMILIA** </br>
Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ th’ world; </br>
 and, having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in </br>
 your own world, and you might quickly make it </br>
 right. </br>

**DESDEMONA** </br>
I do not think there is any such woman. </br>

   *<p style="color:mediumpurple; background-color:lavender">* This exchange specifically juxtaposes two types of women: Desdemona's naive purity (and the image of a perfect, submissive wife) and Emilia's pragmatic realism. It's also a juxtaposition of morality vs. ammorality, and idealized perceptions vs. reality. 

.ve-media wc:Desdemona_by_T.Chasseriau_(Wrightsman_coll.).jpg width="70%" right

**EMILIA** </br>
Yes, a dozen; and as many to th’ vantage as</br>
 would store the world they played for. </br>
But I do think it is their husbands’ faults </br>
 If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties, </br>
 And pour our treasures into foreign laps; </br>
 Or else break out in peevish jealousies, </br>
 Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us, </br>
 Or scant our former having in despite. </br>
 Why, we have [galls](https://www.shakespeareswords.com/Public/GlossaryHeadword.aspx?headwordId=17559), and though we have some grace, </br>
 Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know </br>
 Their wives have sense like them. They see, and </br>
 smell, </br>
 And have their palates both for sweet and sour, </br>
 As husbands have. What is it that they do </br>
 When they change us for others? Is it sport? </br>
 I think it is. And doth affection breed it? </br>
 I think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs? </br>
 It is so too. And have not we affections, </br>
 Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? </br>
 Then let them use us well. Else let them know, </br>
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so. </br>

**DESDEMONA** </br>
Good night, good night. ⟨God⟩ me such uses send, </br>
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend. </br>
    
 *<p style="color:mediumpurple; background-color:lavender">* Shakespeare uses this scene to foreshadow the fact that in less than an hour, both of these women despite their contrasting morals will be dead at the hands of their husbands. It's an important scene because it highlights the voices of these women in an environment where their agency is still preserved, and their husbands will not be able to silence them.    
    
 *<p style="color:hotpink; background-color:lavenderblush">* Historically, this scene was actually cut from many productions!
